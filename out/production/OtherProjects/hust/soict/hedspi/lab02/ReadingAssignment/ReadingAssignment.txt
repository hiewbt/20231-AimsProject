-Encapsulation:
Purpose: To encapsulate the internal state of an object.
Benefits: Protects the internal state, allowing it to be changed without affecting the external interface.

-Read-Only Access:
Purpose: Provide read-only access to private fields.
Benefits: Allows external classes to retrieve information without the ability to modify the internal state.

-Abstraction:
Purpose: Abstracts the internal representation of an object.
Benefits: Enables the class to change its internal structure without affecting the classes that use it.

-Consistency:
Purpose: Enforces a consistent way to access data across different classes.
Benefits: Enhances code readability and maintainability by adhering to a standardized access pattern.

-Compatibility:
Purpose: Maintains compatibility with existing code.
Benefits: If a field's representation changes in the future, accessor methods provide a way to update the internal implementation without breaking external code.

-Validation and Logic:
Purpose: Allows for validation or additional logic during the retrieval of a value.
Benefits: Enables the implementation of custom logic while still providing a consistent external interface.
